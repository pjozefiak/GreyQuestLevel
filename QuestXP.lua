-- Full (un-reduced) quest XP, keyed by quest ID.
--
-- Entries can be added by hand -- Wowhead lists the XP, and the quest ID is in
-- the URL (.../forever/quest=437/the-dead-fields -> 437) -- or imported a zone
-- at a time from a saved Wowhead quest-listing page:
--
--     lua5.1 scripts/import-questxp.lua "wowhead-dump/<zone> Quests.html"
--
-- The importer merges: it never overwrites a value already here, and reports
-- any disagreement instead.
--
-- Entries are grouped by zone, in the order the zones were first imported, and
-- sorted by quest ID within each zone. The `-- <Zone> (zone <id>)` headers are
-- not decoration -- the importer reads them back to work out where each entry
-- belongs, so keep the format if you add a group by hand. Entries added above
-- the first header are left ungrouped until a zone import claims them.
--
-- This is the only source of full quest values. The addon never writes to it,
-- and never caches a value anywhere else: hand in a gray quest that is missing
-- from here and it tells you the quest ID and what the quest paid, so you can
-- add the entry.
--
-- Read at load, so a /reload is needed after editing. `/gql xpdb` reports how
-- many entries are here; `/gql xpdb <questID>` looks one up.
